# incorrigo_syx_script
A script created for new users to get their hands on a real-life IRC client [i.e. mIRC]

Incorrigo Syx IRC network is relatively new, even though it has been around for several years. My favourite IRC client is mIRC, you do the maths.

Here are the instructions to install:

-**(a)** Download mIRC
-**(b)** During setup **_check "Run as Portable Application_** and make sure it does
-**(c)** Complete setup, but don't run mIRC
-**(d)** Download the latest copy of Incorrigo Syx
-**(e)** Extract all the folders and files into the same folder as **mirc.exe**
-**(f)** Overwrite all files, replacing them from the archive
-**(g)** Run _mirc.exe_ ... you may need to register mIRC before you can continue
-**(h)** This is the part where the script kicks in and gives it to you

Some of the messages / the way that things are laid out might come across as _patronising_. This is not intended as an insult, just an attempt to help the concept of an IRC client make sense to people who might not have used it before

I will try to keep things up to date that you will see here
