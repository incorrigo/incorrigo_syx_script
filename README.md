# Incorrigo Syx Script  
A mIRC script developed around the Incorrigo Syx IRC Network

## Find us on IRC
Incorrigo Syx IRC network is relatively new, even though it has been around for several years. You don't need to use mIRC to join our network

## Installation Guide
Here are the instructions to install:
- **(a)** Download mIRC
- **(b)** During setup **_check "Run as Portable Application_** and make sure it does
- **(c)** Complete setup, but don't run mIRC
- **(d)** Download the latest copy of Incorrigo Syx
- **(e)** _(i)_ go into the main folder of the archive (where you will find _mirc.ini_)  
  _(ii)_ from this position in the repository, select all files and folders and drop them into the same folder as **mirc.exe** ... here's how you do it  
- This link will always give you the most recent files for Incorrigo Syx:  
  https://github.com/incorrigo/incorrigo_syx_script/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  

  Here are the files you need to drag into the **_mirc.exe folder_** and you **must overwrite all files and replace** before you first run mirc.exe  

  Note that you need to go into the first folder and copy across the **_files and folders selected in the screenshot_**

  ![A screenshot of the files you need to drag in WinRAR](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-005.png)  
  Once you have done this part, the rest is relatively simple
- **(f)** Overwrite all files, replacing them from the archive as detailed above
- **(g)** Run _mirc.exe_ ... you may need to use your registration code to continue
- **(h)** This is the part where the script kicks in and gives it to you

Some of the messages / the way that things are laid out might come across as _patronising_. But I prefer the term _better_. I will try to keep up with IRC each time it is re-made in another very competitive way

## The Network
It's a reliable proprietary network of servers with a full contingent of IRC services

## This Script
There are a number of targets that have been reached by this classic honest-to-god script for mIRC, and this has led to some defining results not possible with other scripts

### Our script supports +draft/reply + +reply client tags
* Update: +reply now supported also  
If you want to put this feature into your own script, I have created a standalone version ...  
[mIRC replies script by Incorrigo Syx](https://github.com/incorrigo/mIRC_replies)  
  
It works with other clients in exactly the same way that they support it, so when they reply to messages you can see what they're replying to ... and they can see what you're replying to  
![Our ongoing and powerful addition to mIRC which is still not listed as supporting message replies](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-004.png)  

### Dark / Light Mode Support  
You can force the theme to be dark / light - or use the auto setting that changes whenever windows does  
![Also showcasing our support for dark / light mode](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-006.png)

### Away Manager Reminders
A good script would be nothing without a proper away manager...

### Readable Mode Activity (for new users / can be toggled)
By default it is assumed that the user is new to mIRC and doesn't understand modes yet. This can be switched back to normal modes  
![Fast Recovery](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-000.png)  
Getting slapped by an immediate nickname change  

  
![Tactile Response](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-001.png)  
Driven identity recovery  

![Process Simplification](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-002.png)  
Does all the obvious things i.e. releases the hold _and_ changes your nickname without having to log in again twice  

### Unrivalled Client Controls  
![No one has the care and dedication it takes to create such a comprehensive and working architecture of control, and raw power](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-003.png)  
No one has the care and dedication it takes to create such a comprehensive and working architecture of control, and raw power  

### Rapid Reaction Routines
When things don't go right, go left

### Your Journey Starts Here
You need [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) to set up this script, and it's not free software. The cost to register mIRC is barely noticeable and - aside from this script - can open doors for a new IRC user, with an experience that grows more advanced as the user does

## Appraisal of the Incorrigo Syx Script

The **Incorrigo Syx IRC script** - as maintained here - is not simply a script in the traditional sense. It is a fully formed communications architecture; a behavioural framework masquerading as a collection of mIRC menus, aliases, and event hooks. It is, in every meaningful way, a **self-contained operating environment** for IRC—a digital exosuit for the sysop who refuses to operate within the defaults of mediocrity

This script was not designed for the casual user, nor for the passively curious. It is a deliberate, sophisticated, and sometimes confrontational piece of software that expects you to understand what you're doing. And if you don't, it makes no apologies for letting you fall flat on your face

At its core, the Incorrigo Syx system does what IRC itself never attempted: **it renders the unstructured into the structured**. The chaos of channels, the arbitrariness of mode changes, the mute dumbness of /msg—all of it is transformed into a **semantic layer** where context is king, and action is always intentional. This is accomplished through an extensive, context-aware popup system that adapts to channel ownership, user modes, SASL state, and even TLS certificate bindings. Every menu item serves a purpose. Nothing is placed arbitrarily

The script embraces a level of **operational paranoia** that borders on artistic. Unknown users are quietly sandboxed. Channels configured with `+L #` are not just traps—they are mirrors. Users who enter them are told, in so many words, that they have failed an unspoken test. And that failure is logged, processed, and dealt with, quietly, and without ceremony

From a technical perspective, the script exploits the full range of mIRC's capabilities—and then some. It builds custom identifier stacks, conditional access tiers, event sanitisation layers, and real-time mode feedback systems. The rawmode logic alone constitutes a near complete reinterpretation of how IRC ought to describe itself to humans. Rather than echoing unintelligible server gibberish, the script intercepts, rephrases, and contextualises every +o, -h, +q, or +a. It doesn’t just tell you what changed. It tells you why, and who did it

The `/r` system, leveraging IRCv3 tags like `+reply` and `msgid`, pushes the limits of what can be achieved in mIRC. It tracks conversations, caches them, allows visual playback via popups and side windows, and builds a temporary memory for ephemeral exchanges. Echo-message, one of the more misunderstood IRCv3 features, is harnessed here with surgical precision. Message flow is not merely logged—it is sculpted, threaded, echoed, and displayed with context-rich formatting that makes the user feel like they’re navigating a structured interface, not a scrolling log

And then there’s the language. The script does not pretend to be neutral. It speaks in tone, in stance. It mocks you gently when you leave a setting on that you shouldn’t. It warns you with unvarnished candour when you’ve breached a social contract. It lets you know, quite clearly, when you've been billed

All of this is woven together with a visual design that, despite the limits of mIRC, manages to *feel* modern. Unicode glyphs, styled output, layered themes (including dark/light/auto detection), and even time-of-day sensitivity make this script feel alive. There is nothing generic about it. No part of it feels copied or adapted from some scripting archive of the past

To use the Incorrigo Syx script is to submit to a worldview. It is to accept that your interactions—commands, joins, kicks, messages—will be interpreted, filtered, and sometimes vetoed by a system that knows what it’s doing better than you do. It is *opinionated software*, and in an age of soulless AI-generated scaffolds and generic templates, that is perhaps its greatest strength

The Incorrigo Syx script doesn’t just work. It **thinks**, it **critiques**, and it **remembers**

It is, in every way that matters, *alive*
