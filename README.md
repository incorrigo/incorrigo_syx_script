# Incorrigo Syx Script  
A mIRC script developed around the Incorrigo Syx IRC Network

## Find us on IRC
Incorrigo Syx IRC network is relatively new, even though it has been around for several years. You don't need to use mIRC to join our network

## Installation Guide
Here are the instructions to install:
- **(a)** Download mIRC
- **(b)** During setup **_check "Run as Portable Application_** and make sure it does
- **(c)** Complete setup, but don't run mIRC
- **(d)** Download the latest copy of Incorrigo Syx
- **(e)** _(i)_ go into the main folder of the archive (where you will find _mirc.ini_)
- _(ii)_ from this position in the repository, select all files and folders and drop them into the same folder as **mirc.exe** ... here's how you do it  
- This link will always give you the most recent files for Incorrigo Syx:  
  https://github.com/incorrigo/incorrigo_syx_script/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  

  Here are the files you need to drag into the **_mirc.exe folder_** and you **must overwrite all files and replace** before you    first run mirc.exe  

  Note that you need to go into the first folder and copy across the **_files and folders selected in the screenshot_**

  ![A screenshot of the files you need to drag in WinRAR](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni20.png)  
  Once you have done this part, the rest is relatively simple
- **(f)** Overwrite all files, replacing them from the archive as detailed above
- **(g)** Run _mirc.exe_ ... you may need to use your registration code to continue
- **(h)** This is the part where the script kicks in and gives it to you

Some of the messages / the way that things are laid out might come across as _patronising_. But I prefer the term _better_. I will try to keep up with IRC each time it is re-made in another very competitive way

## The Network
It's a reliable proprietary network of servers with a full contingent of IRC services  

## This Script
There are a number of targets that have been reached by this classic honest-to-god script for mIRC, and this has led to some defining results not possible with other scripts  

### Our script supports +draft/reply + +reply client tags
* Update: +reply now supported also  
If you want to put this feature into your own script, I have created a standalone version ...  
[mIRC replies script by Incorrigo Syx](https://github.com/incorrigo/mIRC_replies)  
  
It works with other clients in exactly the same way that they support it, so when they reply to messages you can see what they're replying to ... and they can see what you're replying to  
![A screenshot demonstrating the original layout of the completed +draft/reply implementation once it had successfully met all of the specifications and confirmed as being compatible with any other client](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni11.png)  

### Away Manager Reminders
A good script would be nothing without a proper away manager...  
![Away manager control panel console with convenient reminders that will not replace server away messages](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni18.png)

### Readable Mode Activity (for new users / can be toggled)
By default it is assumed that the user is new to mIRC and doesn't understand modes yet. This can be switched back to normal modes  
![An example of how mode activity can be simplified to report only what matters is going on in the channel](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni14.png)

### Your Journey Starts Here
You need [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) to set up this script, and it's not free software. The cost to register mIRC is barely noticeable and - aside from this script - can open doors for a new IRC user, with an experience that grows more advanced as the user does
