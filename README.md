# incorrigo_script
A script created for new users to get their hands on a real-life IRC client [i.e. mIRC]

The Incorrigo Syx IRC network is relatively new, even though it has existed now for several years. It has some ambitious hopes and unrealistic dreams, but that doesn't stop me from having a network that's fun to upgrade and reconfigure

Some serious work and passion has gone into the development of a network that (in my head) people who are getting absolutely rinsed in the _"banter"_ of social media, really need. There are plenty of IRC clients, I deploy kiwiirc on mine, with a twist of PHP so if anyone had a channel they would be able to create a direct link to it, leaving it a case of type a nickname and go

With new users that's probably all they will need for a while, but I like mIRC so I started writing a script that would explain IRC to any new user / provide easy to use settings for them / **_still_** be an environment that a pro user could open up a tab and participate in

Here are the instructions to install:
**(a)** Download mIRC
**(b)** During setup **_check "Run as Portable Application_** and make sure it does
**(c)** Complete setup, but don't run mIRC
**(d)** Download the latest copy of Incorrigo Syx
**(e)** Extract all the folders and files into the same folder as **mirc.exe**
**(f)** Overwrite all files, replacing them from the archive
**(g)** Run _mirc.exe_ ... you may need to register mIRC before you can continue
**(h)** This is the part where the script kicks in and gives it to you

Some of the messages / the way that things are laid out might come across as _patronising_. This is not intended as an insult, just an attempt to help the concept of an IRC client make sense to people who might not have used it before
