# Incorrigo Syx Script  
A mIRC script developed around the Incorrigo Syx IRC Network

## Latest Script News  
A new mIRC version is being released all the time, and at the same time this is happening, IRCv3 is bringing this beloved protocol into the 21st century one decision at a time  
  
Incorrigo Syx Script keeps a legend of the ideal default settings it would require mIRC to have. Obviously you might want to change those settings, and that will not stop the script from working. This is one of the reasons why the features and functionality architecture comes in script files that are largely self contained...  
  
Having the latest mIRC version / updating your mirc.ini settings are important because new features that will come in their own files respectively, will not be included if you have not updated your mirc.ini settings. To make sure you are getting the most up to date mirc.ini, get it straight from https://github.com/incorrigo/incorrigo_syx_script [the front page of this repository] regardless of how recently a version has been released  
  
New releases are only issued when there has been a lot of stable changes that have successfully withstood an appropriate frequency of edge cases. In between releases, there are a large number of changes not just to our script files but also our famous elite popup menu system  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
  
The method of script setup is still simple as ever:  
  
	[install mirc - check "run as portable application"]  
		-->  
	[download incorrigo syx script]  
		-->  
	[extract entire script alongside mirc.exe - overwriting everything]  
		-->  
	[make sure you extract all subfolders into same place]  
		-->  
	[run mIRC] -- you may be required to enter your licence information  

  If these instructions are too difficult for you, please remember that we keep more detailed help about or script in the [incorrigo syx user guide](https://syxi.incorrigo.io/how-to "Network User Guide")

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Some useful tips:  
  
	- Check for updates here regularly. Improvements and adjustments are being uploaded all the time  
	- You only need to update mirc.ini if it's newer than the one you already have  
	- It is unlikely that mIRC will need your registration info again  
	- Leave any extra files [don't have a new version / generated by mIRC] they're fine where they are  
	- To send a message reply quickly, doubleclick the query / channel screen  
	- Script only assistance is available in #help, just like any network related help  
  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Don't forget to update [overwrite all] the `/script` folder, especially `popups.ini` ... this is probably one of the most heavily maintained features about the script and improvements are being made all the time. It is not in the `/incorrigo-syx` directory so it can be easy to overlook while you update all the script files

## The Network  
You don't need to use our script to get the most out of our network, but it helps. You can use any client, and bots are permitted  
  
Your questions may be answered by our [Legit Statement](https://incorrigo.io/legit) where you can discover where we are at in terms of permanent uptime / persistent settings  


## Script Accomplishments  
We don't rely on DLLs or executables. It's 100% mIRC script, which will work for almost any version of the client. Here are some things we've accomplished  

### We made mIRC support +reply +draft/reply  
Replies to any message (including your own) is fully compatible with every other client and complies fully to the IRCv3 specification  
  
When other clients use replies, you can see the same things they are
![Not even a function of mIRC. Supported by mIRC](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-004.png)  

### Dark / Light Mode Support  
There are three settings:  
**(i)** Auto [changes to light/dark theme depending on windows setting]  
**(ii)** Light Mode [forces light colour scheme regardless of dark mode setting]  
**(iii)** Dark Mode [forces dark colour scheme regardless of dark mode setting]  
![Appreciate the new native dark mode support](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-006.png)  

### Away Manager  
Incorrigo Syx script has an automatic away setting by default. You can change the auto timer, or you can set away. _[the /away command will still work if you want to use that instead]_  

When you are mentioned in a channel, receive a private message of any kind; you can turn reminders on/off for these different things - away reminder will be sent to the user if you want it to

### Readable Mode Activity (for new users / can be toggled)
![Getting the mode changes in plain english, with warnings](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni14.png)  
If you join a channel, the modes are scanned automatically. You will always get a full read-out of all the modes that are set

When a channel is registered or someone is made a channel op, the read-out is more legible. However, you can turn this off and your decision will be remembered by the script settings  

### Circumstance Alerts  
Even an experienced user might not understand how the channel will behave. The modes might be different on this network than what they are used to, so the script will give you **circumstance alerts** ... an alert for each circumstance you're in, on the channel that you have joined  
  
The script will tell you as soon as you've joined the channel, before you learn anything the hard way.  
![Channel circumstance alerts](https://syxi.incorrigo.io/script/scripti023.png)

### Fast Nickname Recovery  
When your nickname is protected by a services hold, the script will recover and log in with your password. Example:  
![Tactile Response](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-001.png)  

Instead of _recover, login_ which requires your account info twice  
![Process Simplification](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-002.png)  
Certainly better than logging into your account twice  

### Comprehensive Client Controls  
![No one has the care and dedication it takes to create such a comprehensive and working architecture of control, and raw power](https://incorrigo.io/script/screeni2-003.png)  
Many of the client controls are menu driven, with context mode visibility    

### Extended Join Activity  
When someone (or you) joins a channel you're on, metadata is displayed i.e. _the account_ they are logged into, and their _"real name"_ [**NB:** you do not have to use your real name, that's just what this information is commonly called]

![Extended Join information attached to join messages from registered and unregistered users](https://syxi.incorrigo.io/script/scripti022.png)  
This can be really useful if you use the account name to determine whether someone is who they say they are, or not. **Remember:** You can still use an unregistered nickname, and remain logged into your user account  

  If you are interested in using us as an obscure way to contact people discretely e.g. charities that work with vulnerable people, we would like you to contact us [not just about the script but our network in general] ... our network is available and absolutely free to use, on any IRC client or in your browser

## An Intelligent Synopsis  
The **Incorrigo Syx Script** - as maintained here - is not simply a script in the traditional sense. It is a fully formed communications architecture; a behavioural framework of a collection of mIRC menus, aliases, and event hooks. It is, in every meaningful way, a **self-contained operating environment** for IRC -- a digital exosuit for the sysop who refuses to operate within the defaults of mediocrity

This script was not designed for the casual user, nor for the passively curious. It is a deliberate, sophisticated, and sometimes confrontational piece of software that needs no-one to understand what you're doing. And if you don't, it gives you what's going on in plain english

At its core, the Incorrigo Syx system does what IRC itself never attempted: **it renders the unstructured into the structured**. The chaos of channels, the arbitrariness of mode changes, the mute dumbness of /msg .. all of it is transformed into a **semantic layer** where context is king, and action is always intentional. This is accomplished through an extensive, context-aware popup system that adapts to channel ownership, user modes, SASL state, and even TLS certificate bindings. Every menu item serves a purpose. Nothing is placed arbitrarily

From a technical perspective, the script exploits the full range of mIRC's capabilities—and then some. It builds custom identifier stacks, conditional access tiers, event sanitisation layers, and real-time mode feedback systems. The rawmode logic alone constitutes a near complete reinterpretation of how IRC ought to describe itself to humans. Rather than echoing unintelligible server gibberish, the script intercepts, rephrases, and contextualises every +o, -h, +q, or +a. It doesn’t just tell you what changed. It tells you why, and who did it

The `+draft/reply` system, leveraging IRCv3 tags like `+reply` and `msgid`, pushes the limits of what can be achieved in mIRC. It tracks conversations, caches them, allows visual playback via popups and side windows, and builds a temporary memory for ephemeral exchanges. Echo-message, one of the more misunderstood IRCv3 features, is harnessed here with surgical precision. Message flow is not merely logged—it is sculpted, threaded, echoed, and displayed with context-rich formatting that makes the user feel like they’re navigating a structured interface, not a scrolling log

And then there’s the language. The script does not pretend to be neutral. It speaks in tone, in stance. It mocks you gently when you leave a setting on that you shouldn’t. It warns you with unvarnished candour  
  
All of this is woven together with a visual design that, despite the limits of mIRC, manages to *feel* modern. Unicode glyphs, styled output, layered themes (including dark/light/auto detection), and even time-of-day sensitivity make this script feel alive. There is nothing generic about it. No part of it feels copied or adapted from some scripting archive of the past; because it isn't  
  
To use the Incorrigo Syx script is to accept that your interactions—commands, joins, kicks, messages—will be interpreted, filtered, and sometimes vetoed by a system that knows what it’s doing better than you do. It is *opinionated software*, and in an age of soulless AI-generated scaffolds and generic templates, that is perhaps its greatest strength

It is, in every way that matters, *alive*
