# incorrigo_syx_script
A script created for new users to get their hands on a real-life IRC client [i.e. mIRC]

## Find us on IRC
Incorrigo Syx IRC network is relatively new, even though it has been around for several years. My favourite IRC client is mIRC, you do the maths.

## Installation Guide
Here are the instructions to install:
- **(a)** Download mIRC
- **(b)** During setup **_check "Run as Portable Application_** and make sure it does
- **(c)** Complete setup, but don't run mIRC
- **(d)** Download the latest copy of Incorrigo Syx
- **(e)** Extract all the folders and files into the same folder as **mirc.exe**
- **(f)** Overwrite all files, replacing them from the archive
- **(g)** Run _mirc.exe_ ... you may need to register mIRC before you can continue
- **(h)** This is the part where the script kicks in and gives it to you

Some of the messages / the way that things are laid out might come across as _patronising_. But I prefer the term _better_. I will try to keep up with IRC each time it is re-made in another very competitive way

## The Network
It's quite simple to detail the features of the network - it's a map of nodes running the latest stable UnrealIRCd and a network manager in the form of anope services. But to us, it's more than that. It's a text based virtual world.

## This Script
There are a number of targets that have been reached by this classic honest-to-god script for mIRC, and this has led to some defining results not possible with other scripts

### IRCv3 +draft/reply Supported by mIRC
This is not a joke, mIRC now officially supports +draft/reply= and it's all thanks to this glorious script. It would have to be spiteful not to be pleased to discover this (we did it first)

### Away Manager Reminders
It's difficult to tell you the good points about our script without mentioning **_away manager_**, which brings raw functionality right down to the command level so when someone mentions your name in a channel that you're on, they can be certain their witty retort to what you said a few hours ago definitely didn't land

### Opt-out Readable Mode Activity
Modes seldom change throughout the course of a given day when in an IRC session, especially when it's gone full on idle for days. Considerable care has gone into showing you the permissions that were altered as a result of a mode change. This feature is for new users primarily, and can be switched off completely in one click

### Your Journey Starts Here
Unfortunately I can't provide anyone with [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) and it is not free software. You will have to make that arrangement separately - but once you have done, this script will give you your money's worth
