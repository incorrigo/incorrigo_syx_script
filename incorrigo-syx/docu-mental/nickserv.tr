nickserv is the user account registration and management service

When you change your nickname to something else or go offline, the nickname you were using becomes available again for everyone

If you have become known to others as a certain nickname, this would be inconvenient because anyone could then impersonate you and no one [not even you] would be able to stop them from taking in what "you" have said

This is where nickserv comes in. When you have registered an account with nickserv - all you need is a password and an email address you have access to - your nickname [a group of nicknames can belong to one account, so you only need to go through the verification process once] will be reserved so that no one but you will be able to use it

When you're registered, anyone [even you] who logs on / changes to your nickname(s) will be challenged. To log in, you need to identify with your password. Also, you can use a self-signed client certificate fingerprint, which will allow you to log in without a password and more securely

Registration allows you to have a vanity hostname [hostserv] and you can be given permission to operate / co-own registered channels, and even register channels of your own

All nicknames that are registered in your group will share the same privileges and permissions / even services operator [a services operator is someone who has extra permissions to control / change things to help general users]

To get started with nickserv, use this command: /query nickserv help
